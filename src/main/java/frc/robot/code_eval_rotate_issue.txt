At its core, your code is using WPILib’s trajectory-generation system to create and follow paths for your swerve-drive robot during autonomous. You’ve set up a bunch of preset poses—like your starting nodes, reef nodes, and so on—and you generate trajectories based on these poses. Then you use a PID-based controller (with a twist for theta, to handle angular motion continuously) to have the robot follow the path.

But here’s where things get a little… tricky, especially when you switch team colors.

### What's Happening in the Code

1. **Defining Poses**  
   You create poses using your helper method `simplePose(x, y, angleDegrees)`, which essentially packages up an (x, y) coordinate with an orientation (converted from degrees to a `Rotation2d`). For example:

   ```java
   startingNodes[0] = simplePose(7.671, 7.279, 0); // Cage position 1
   ```

   This sets up a starting position, but note—these angles are hard-coded without any transformation for team color.

2. **Trajectory Generation**  
   In `generatePath`, you:
   
   - **Configure the trajectory** with max speed and acceleration.
   - Convert your custom pose objects (`PosPose2d`) into WPILib’s `Pose2d` and `Translation2d` objects.
   - Generate the trajectory using these points.
   
   Then you set up three PID controllers:
   
   - Two for X and Y, using basic PID.
   - A *ProfiledPIDController* for theta (heading), which is set to use continuous input between -π and π. This is meant to smoothly handle the wrap-around of angles.

3. **Following the Trajectory**  
   You construct a `SwerveControllerCommand` that:
   
   - Reads the current pose from your swerve subsystem.
   - Uses the controllers to command the drive modules to follow the trajectory.
   
   Finally, the command is wrapped in a `SequentialCommandGroup` so that once the path is finished, it stops the modules.

### The Likely Issue with Team Color Switching

Now, here’s the crucial part: When you change team color, the field’s coordinate system is essentially mirrored (or transformed) to suit the new perspective. That means **both** your positions and your orientations (the angles) need to be adjusted.

You have a helper method called `teamChangeAngle`:

```java
public static Rotation2d teamChangeAngle(double degrees){
    if(SwerveSubsystem.isOnRed())
        return  Rotation2d.fromDegrees(-degrees + 180);
    return  Rotation2d.fromDegrees(degrees); 
}
```

This function is clearly meant to transform the angle based on the team—if the robot is on the red team, it flips the angle appropriately. However, notice that in your trajectory generation and when setting odometry, you’re directly using `simplePose` without applying this transformation.

For example, in your test command you have:

```java
swerveSubsystem.resetOdometry(simplePose(7.589, 3.929, 180));
...
generatePath(swerveSubsystem, simplePose(7.589, 3.929, 180), List.of(), simplePose(2.746, 4.066, 180))
```

This means that even if the robot is on a different team (say red), the angles aren’t being transformed by `teamChangeAngle`. As a result, while your positions might be correctly mirrored somewhere else in your code or setup, the orientation values aren’t, causing a mismatch.

When the robot tries to follow the trajectory, the `thetaController` sees a target orientation that doesn’t match the transformed field’s reality. Consequently, the robot starts rotating unexpectedly as it tries to “correct” its heading to match the untransformed angle—even though its position might be spot on.

### In Summary

- **Path Planning Process:**  
  You define poses, generate a trajectory (including intermediate waypoints), and then use a swerve controller command to follow that trajectory using PID controllers.
  
- **Team Color Transformation Issue:**  
  - **Positions vs. Orientations:** When switching teams, it’s common to mirror or otherwise transform the positions. But if you forget to apply a similar transformation to the robot’s heading, the robot’s expected orientation will be off.
  - **Missing Application:** You have the `teamChangeAngle` method to handle heading adjustments, but it’s not being used when setting your odometry or creating your trajectory.
  - **Result:** The robot rotates while moving because it’s continuously trying to correct to a heading that doesn’t account for the field’s mirrored layout.

### What You Can Do

1. **Apply the Transformation Consistently:**  
   Use `teamChangeAngle` (or a similar transformation) when creating your poses. For instance, if your robot is on the red team, you might modify your `simplePose` calls like this:

   ```java
   swerveSubsystem.resetOdometry(simplePose(7.589, 3.929, teamChangeAngle(180).getDegrees()));
   ```

   And similarly, apply it in `generatePath` for your start and end points.

2. **Double-Check Your Pose Conversion:**  
   Ensure that the `toFieldPose2d()` method in your `PosPose2d` class also respects any team color transformation. If it’s not, that’s another place where the mismatch might occur.

By keeping the transformation consistent for both the position and orientation, your trajectory’s desired heading will match the actual field configuration, and the robot shouldn’t unexpectedly rotate while following the path.
